  - The part of the GUI that controls the way windows appear is called the **window manager**
* Windowing system(display server):
  - It is the core of most GUIs, most windowing systems use the WIMP structure(Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer).
  - Windowing systems provide the basica framework for other parts of the GUI.
* X11 (X Window System Version 11)
  - It is a **protocol used** by the common windowing system called **Xorg** used on Linux systems.
* Xorg:
  - It is a **windowing system**, allows the movement of windows and input interactions(such as the mouse and keyboard)
* Xlib:
  - It is a **C Programming library** for interacting with display servers using the **X11 protocol**
* Widget-toolkit:
  > It is a set of software or a library that works with the window manager to design the window's appearance.
  > It defines how a window should appear.
