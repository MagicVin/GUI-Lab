Terminal type or emulation specifices how your computer and the host computer to which you are connected exchange information.  
You need to set your terminal type so that both computers communicate in the same way.  
Otherwise, your telnet, SSH, or terminal application will not have enough information to perform actions such as clearing the screen, moving the cursor around, and placing characters.  

The most commonly emulated terminal type is Digital Equipmet Corporation(DEC) VT100 terminal. Most PC and MacOS terminal emulation packages support this type.
