# XTerm - Terminal for X
  The xterm program is a terminal emulator for the X Window System. It provides DEC VT102/VT220 and selected features from higher-level terminals such as VT320/VT420/VT520 (VTxxx).  
  
  ## Emulations
  xterm provides usable emulations of related DEC terminals:
  * VT52 emulation is complete.
  * VT102 emulator is fairly complete, but does not support autorepeat(because that would affect the keyboard by other X clients)
  *
