There are many Linux desktop environments available, including but not limited to Unity, Cinnamon, GNOME, KDE, XFCE, LXDE and Enlightenment.These components are commonly used to make a Linux desktop environment.

1. Window Manager  
A window manager determines how applications are presented to the user on the screen.
There are different types of window managers available:
* Compositing: Modern Linux desktop environments use compositing to display windows. Windows appear on top of each other, snap side by side, and look pleasing to the eye.
* Stacking: A stacking window manager places windows on top of each other but they look more old-fashioned.
* Tiling: A tiling window manager puts windows side by side without letting them overlap.  
Typically, a window can have borders, be minimized and maximized, be resized, and be dragged around the screen. The window has a title, may contain a context menu, and items can be selected with the mouse.  
A window manager lets you tab between windows, send them to a taskbar(also know as a panel), snap the windows side by side, and perform other tasks.

2. Panels  
In the Windows operating system, the panel is the taskbar. Linux can have multiple panels on the screen.  
A panel generally sits at the edge of the screen either at the top, bottom, left, or right. The panel contains items such as a menu, quick launch icons, minimized applications, and a system tray or notification area.
